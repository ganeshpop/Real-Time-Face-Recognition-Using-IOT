# Real-Time-Face-Recognition-Using-IOT
IOT BASED REAL TIME FACE RECOGNITION ANDROID APPLICATION with Python and IBM Cloud using Raspberry pi, MIT App Inventor and OpenCV.
Real Time Face Recognition

Project Overview:

To Create a Realtime Face Recognition Service using IOT through IBM Cloud.

Standards:

•	OpenCV

•	IBM Cloud

•	Node-Red

•	MIT App Inventor

Objectives:

•	Installing OpenCV.

•	Creating IBM Cloud Services. 

•	Getting Service Credentials From IBM.

•	Creating Node-Red Flow.

•	Creating MIT-App.

•	Establishing Communication Between These Services.

Requirements/Task(s):

Task 1 – Writing a Python Code

Task 2 – Importing Required Libraries Along with OpenCV.

Task 3 - Provide a set of images to the python code to utilize them as known faces.

Task 4 – Providing Services Credentials to Code.

Task 5 – Connecting to IBM Cloud with Providing Services Credentials.

Task 6 – Detect Faces from Each Frame.

Task 7 – Continuously Publish Detected Faces to the IBM Cloud.

Task 8 – Create a Node-Red Flow.

Task 9 – Create a Dash Board Through Node-Red.

Task 10 – Publish Detected Faces into URL Through Node-Red.

Task 11 – Create an MIT-App.

Task 12 – Continuously Retrieve Detected Faces into the MIT-App through the URL.

Task 13 – Display Corresponding Images for the Retrieved Face.

	

Description:
A REAL TIME FACE RECOGNITION system is capable of identifying or verifying a person from a video frame. To recognize the face in a frame, first you need to detect whether the face is present in the frame. If it is present, mark it as a Region of Interest (ROI), extract the ROI and process it for facial recognition.


Summarize what you learned:
We Learnt OpenCV Implementation, Working of IBM Cloud, Using Node-Red Flow, Creating Apps Using MIT-App Inventor. Among the things we have learnt Node-Red was the easiest to Work with. Publishing Data through code and retrieving it was little challenging. Next time we aim for Real Time Object Recognition through IBM Watson.
